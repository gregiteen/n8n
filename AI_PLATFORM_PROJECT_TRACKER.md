# AI Platform - Project Tracker

**Version 1.1.0**  
**Last Updated: June 12, 2025**

## Project Overview

This document tracks the progress of the AI Platform development, a chat-driven task management platform built on top of n8n. The platform leverages AI agents (using SDKs like OpenAI) to orchestrate tasks, with n8n workflows available as tools through webhooks. It includes MCP server generation capabilities for any API, allowing seamless integration between agents and external services.

## Current Status

- **Project Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation
- **Overall Progress**: 87%
- **Current Sprint**: Sprint 3 (June 1-14, 2025)
- **Next Milestone**: Core Platform Completion (July 15, 2025)
